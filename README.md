# Metaheuristic algorithms

### What are these algorithms?
Metaheuristic algorithms are optimization algorithms that are used to address complicated issues that cannot be solved using standard approaches. 

These algorithms are inspired by natural processes such as **genetics, swarm behavior, and evolution**, and they are used to explore a broad search space to identify the global optimum of a problem.


### Examples of some metaheuristic algorithms implemented in Julia:

- [Genetic algorithm](/src/genetic_algorithm)
- [Particle swarm optimization](/src/pso)

TO-DO:
- Ant colony optimization
